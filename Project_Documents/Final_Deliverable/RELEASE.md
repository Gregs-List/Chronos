## Notes:
After logging in, the NavBar at the top of the page will allow you to view your account information, create a new listing, go to the home page, search, or log out. The links in the side bar will take you to a list of the listings in that category from most to least recent.

### Log In / Sign Up
If you have an account, you may enter your SMU e-mail address and GregsList password into the login fields at the top to enter the site. If not, you may fill out the signup form on the right. First Name and Last Name must be filled out with alphabetical characters only. Passwords must be at least 8 characters. The SMU e-mail address must not already be registered.

### [Home][2]
On this page, you will find the top navigation bar, the category bar on the side, the search bar, and a slide show of the 5 most recent listings. Click the arrow on the bottom center of the slide show to reveal the listing summary. Click the left and right arrows to go back and forth in the slideshow. The slideshow will progress on its own, otherwise.

### [My Account][3]
On this page, you will see your SMU e-mail address and your phone number, if you have saved one. You may enter or change your phone number on this page. You will also see all your posted listings and links to edit or delete them.

### [Create Listing][4]
On this page, you will see several blank fields to be filled out. The fields shown will depend on the category you select in the drop-down menu. Not all fields are mandatory, and mandatory fields left blank will cause an alert to appear if you try to submit. A photo may be uploaded to accompany the listing, and is recommended.

### [Edit Listing]
Reach this page by clicking on the "Edit" link by a listing under "My Listings" on your account page. Here, you will find a form resembling the one you filled out to create the listing. Edit whichever values you wish, then click "Save Changes."

### Search
Enter a word or phrase in the search bar and click "Search" to find listings with the word or phrase in their title or description. To filter results, click one of the radio buttons by the desired category near the top.

### View Full Listing
On any page where listings are, well, listed, click the title of a listing to view its full details. You will be taken to a page with the listing's full information, a photo if available, and the poster's contact information should you wish to buy the item.

### View Category
In the navigation bar on the left you will find listing categories. Select any one of them to see all the listings in that category from most to least recent.

### Logout
The Logout link in the top navigation bar will end the user's session and take them back to the log in screen.
