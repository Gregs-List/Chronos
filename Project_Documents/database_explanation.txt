The GregsList database model is about linking users with classified advertisements. The Users table contains user contact information, login information, and OAuth information for 3rd party authentication. Their unique user IDs are used to associate them with listings in the Listings table, which contains basic information about the items being sold common to nearly every listing. More detailed information specific to the kind of item being advertised is stored in separate tables for each category, with integer indexes to certain repeated values like type and condition. URLs to photos for listings are also kept in a separate table, theoretically allowing for a listing to have any number of photos. This model allows for varying levels of information to be retrieved as needed.
